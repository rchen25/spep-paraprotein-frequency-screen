# Serum protein electrophoresis paraprotein screening tool


## About

We provide a method for screening SPEPs for paraproteins.


## Usage

The method takes as input, a serum protein electrophoresis densitometry curve as well as an associated control densitometry curve (does not contain a paraprotein). 


### Input format

Input file with columns:

* **sebiaSerumCurve**: string in hexadecimal format for serum curve from Sebia device
* **sebiaSerumGelControlCurve**: string in hexadecimal format for control curve from Sebia device

Sample input file is in `data/sample_input_data.csv`

### Steps to run screening tool
#### Step 1

Initialize environment

```
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Step 2

Run the algorithm with input

```
python paraprotein_screen.py data/sample_input_data.csv
```

Output will be generated by default in `./output.csv`
